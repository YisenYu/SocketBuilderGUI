1,2,3there could be up to three different types of pins in a single design

<PCB>
[orientation] edge;
# either "edge" or "node" of string type (case-insensitive);

<Package>
[type] BGA;
# {"LGA" , "BGA" , "PGA"} 


<Package>
[ball_type] 0;
# this is an integer of following values:
# (in the mean time, we only need to display as perfect sphere with the top part cut off)
# 0: sphere; the BGA ball is drawn as a partial sphere with top part cut off
# 1: cylinder; the BGA ball is drawn as a cylinder
# 2: not allowed
# 3~8: the BGA ball is drawn as a poly-sphere; this is the number of edges in the vertical cross-section 
#  (the horizontal sections are regulated by [ball_poly])

[bga_ori] edge;
# the two allowable values are {"edge", "node"};

<Analysis>
[sweep_type] interpolating;
#  allowable values are {"interpolate", "discrete"}; case-insensitive
[boundary] radiation;
#  allowable values are {"radiation", "abc", "pec", "pmc"}; case-insensitive
[accuracy] normal;
#  allowable values are {"fast", "normal", "high"}; case-insensitive
